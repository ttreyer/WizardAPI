Wizard GraphQL API
==================

The repository for the GraphQL workshop given at LauzHack.
You can follow the presentation along with [the slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1grd9Zr3r3BX9K1GWbdxnyhDXOt_5bHbn7aIdWU5zy34/edit?usp=sharing).

Make sure you have [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/download) installed and start the server like this:

    $ npm install
    $ node src/index.js

You can now reach the playground [localhost:4000](http://localhost:4000) :)

Try to complete the missing resolvers!

You can find the complete solution on the branche `done`.

**Good Luck and Have Fun**
